# 📄 Paging Algorithm Simulator

[![Try Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20Live-Click%20Here-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://sanaarshad-cs.github.io/paging-simulator/)

A visual simulator for classic **Page Replacement Algorithms** used in Operating Systems:

🔹 FIFO (First-In-First-Out)  
🔹 LRU (Least Recently Used)  
🔹 Optimal Page Replacement  
🔹 Second Chance Algorithm  
🔹 Belady’s Anomaly Visualization  

Built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for easy learning, simulation, and interaction.

## 📚 Features

- ✅ Interactive input for frames and reference string  
- ✅ Clear table visualization with page hits/misses  
- ✅ Total hit/miss counter at the bottom  
- ✅ Each algorithm in a separate file  
- ✅ Lightweight and fast — no frameworks needed  
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with responsive design
