# 📄 Paging Simulator

A visual simulator for **Page Replacement Algorithms**:  
➡️ FIFO (First-In-First-Out)  
➡️ LRU (Least Recently Used)  
➡️ Optimal  
➡️ Second Chance  
➡️ Belady’s Anomaly  

Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this educational tool helps understand how these algorithms work step by step with colorful, interactive outputs.
