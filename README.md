# 📄 Paging Algorithm Simulator

[![Try Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20Live-Click%20Here-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://sanaarshad-cs.github.io/paging-simulator/)


A visual simulator for classic **Page Replacement Algorithms** used in Operating Systems:

🔹 FIFO (First-In-First-Out)  
🔹 LRU (Least Recently Used)  
🔹 Optimal Page Replacement  
🔹 Second Chance Algorithm  
🔹 Belady’s Anomaly Visualization  

Built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for easy learning, simulation, and interaction.
